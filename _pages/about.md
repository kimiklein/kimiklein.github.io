I am a professor for theoretical computer science at the University of LÃ¼beck. Previously, I worked on my own [DFG project](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/person/442077393?context=person&task=showDetail&id=442077393&) on the topic "Approximation Methods in Integer Programming" at Kiel University. Before, I was a visiting professor at the University of Bremen and a PostDoc at EPFL in the group of Friedrich Eisenbrand. I received my PhD at Kiel University where I was adviced by Klaus Jansen.
