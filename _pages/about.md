About me
------
I work as a postdoctoral researcher in algorithm theory and discrete optimization at Kiel University. Currently I work on my own [DFG project](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/person/442077393?context=person&task=showDetail&id=442077393&) on the topic "Approximation Methods in Integer Programming". Before that I was a PostDoc at EPFL in the group of Friedrich Eisenbrand. I received my PhD at Kiel University where I was adviced by Klaus Jansen.

Main Interests
------
My main research goal is to build an algorithmic theory based on structured integer programs.
 - Integer Programming
 - Combinatorial Optimization
 - Approximation Algorithms
 - Paramterized Complexity
 - Bin Packing/Scheduling Problems
 - Fine-Grained Complexity
